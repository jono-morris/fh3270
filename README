Free Host 3270.

What works:

The TN3270 Emulator applet, the SessionServer servlet, and the
Free Host 3270 servlet (the one that delivers the emulator applet), all
seem to work ok.

What doesn't work:

* Print -The screen may get clipped at the edges because the margin settings 
are difficult to work with. Look for a fix soon!

* HTML 'Screen Scrape' - The source is in the tree, but the
distribution doesn't have it enabled.  STATUS: Tested and enabled in
next release.

REALLY QUICK START

Assuming you already have Java Servlet compliant container, copy
the fh3270.war file to the container's ./webapps directory.
Most containers will auto-deploy your war.

goto http://<wherever your container is>/fh3270/freehost

You should see the Java Emulator pop up and connect to
Harvard's HOLLIS server.
